/**
 * This file serves as documentation for the refactored villager mixin system.
 * 
 * The original monolithic VillagerEntityMixin has been split into focused concerns:
 * 
 * 1. VillagerLifecycleMixin - Handles villager initialization, death, profession changes, and basic lifecycle
 * 2. VillagerAIIntegrationMixin - Manages AI system integration and updates
 * 3. VillagerInteractionMixin - Handles player interactions, greetings, and information display
 * 4. VillagerEntityMixinLegacy - Contains edge cases and special events (lightning, waking up)
 * 
 * This separation follows SOLID principles:
 * - Single Responsibility Principle: Each mixin has one clear purpose
 * - Open/Closed Principle: New functionality can be added by creating new mixins
 * - Interface Segregation Principle: Each mixin only depends on what it needs
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Easier to maintain and debug
 * - Reduced coupling between different concerns  
 * - Better testability
 * - Clearer code organization
 * - Reduced risk of conflicts when multiple developers work on villager behavior
